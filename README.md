# BitwardenDecrypt
Decrypts an encrypted [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden) data.json file (from the Desktop App).  
You can safely store data.json as an encrypted, offline backup of your vault knowing you will always be able to decrypt it.

To determine the location of the data.json file see:  
https://bitwarden.com/help/data-storage/#on-your-local-machine

*Note: BitwardenDecrypt does not work with Bitwarden Encrypted JSON Exports.<br/>
These exports lack the Protected Symmetric Key needed to decrypt entries.*

*Password Protected Encrypted JSON Exports* are supported.


<br/>

Outputs JSON containing:
- Logins
- Folders
- Organizations
- Collections
- Cards
- Secure Notes
- Identities
- Sends *(Optional)*

*Note: Outputs (almost) all key/value pairs, including ones you probably don't care about.*

### Usage: 
```
./BitwardenDecrypt.py [options]  (reads data.json from current directory)
or
./BitwardenDecrypt.py [options] inputfile

Password: (Enter Password)

Options:
        --includesends          Include Sends in the output.
        --output OUTPUTFILE     Write decrypted output to file.
                                Will overwrite contents if file exists.
        --output-encoding ENCODING
                                Specify encoding to use for --output.
                                (defaults to the current locale encoding)
```
On Windows:
```
py BitwardenDecrypt.py [options]
or
py BitwardenDecrypt.py [options] inputfile

Password: (Enter Password)

Options:
        --includesends          Include Sends in the output.
        --output OUTPUTFILE     Write decrypted output to file.
                                Will overwrite contents if file exists.
        --output-encoding ENCODING
                                Specify encoding to use for --output
                                (defaults to 'utf-8')
```
*Note: This script depends on the 'cryptography' package  
pip install cryptography*

## Limitations

- Attachments are not supported (they are not stored locally in data.json)
- Does not work with Bitwarden Encrypted JSON Exports.
<br/>*These exports lack the Protected Symmetric Key needed to decrypt entries.*
<br/>(Password Protected Encrypted JSON Exports are now supported)
- ~~No validation of the CipherString.
I.e. No verification of the MAC before decrypting.~~ Now verifies the MAC.
- Can only decrypt EncryptionType: 2 (AesCbc256_HmacSha256_B64).  At the time of writing this is the default used for all entries in the personal vault.
- ~~Does not decrypt anything from a Collection (Organization).~~<br/>Initial support for decrypting items from a Collection (Organization). This adds support for decrypting EncryptionType: 4 (Rsa2048_OaepSha1_B64)


## To Do
[ ] Nothing.
Hopefully Bitwarden will implement an [encrypted export](https://community.bitwarden.com/t/encrypted-export/235) and this script can become obsolete.
